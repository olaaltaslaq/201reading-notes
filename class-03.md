## **Lists**

*Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read. In modern web development, lists are workhorse elements, frequently used for navigation as well as general content.*

## **Boxes**

*In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.*

# JavaScript

>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.


## **swich statements**

*The switch statement executes a block of code depending on different cases. The switch statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.*

## **Loops**

*Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.*

**for**

if we need to run code a specifec number of times , we use a for loop ' it is the most common loop' in a for loop the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop shoud run.

**while**

if we do'nt know how many times the code should run , we can use a while loop , in this condition can be something other than a count , and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.

**do while**

the do while loop is very similer to the while loop , but has one key difference it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once , even if the condition evaluates to false.
