# Domain Modeling

*Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.*

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

2- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

3- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

4- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

5- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

6- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## **Tables**

*HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns, a table represents information in grid format.*

### Table structure:

An HTML table consists of one < table > element and one or more < tr >, < th >, and < td > elements. The < tr > element defines a table row, the < th > element defines a table header, and the < td > element defines a table cell. An HTML table may also include < caption >, < colgroup >, < thead >, < tfoot >, and < tbody > elements.

## **Functions**

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

)

## **Methods**
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

## **Objects**

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

### Array is object?
arrays are actually a special type of object they hold a related set of key/value pairs but the key for each value is its index number.
