*Given an HTML document and the task is to create a JavaScript link and add it to the document using JavaScript.*

Approach:

- Append <a> element in the body.

## **function**

A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements)*
