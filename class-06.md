## **Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming**

*The single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain, Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain*

**What is the hardest thing about writing code?**

There are many common answers to this question:

- Learning a new technology
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable
- The list goes on and on.

## **Object Literals**

A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

**creating an object:**

*litral notation literal ntoation in the easiset and most popular way to creat objecte.*

**accessing an object and dot notation:**

*we access the propertis or methods of an object using dot notation we can also access properties using square brackets*

> Dot notation : access a property or method of an object you use the name of the object followed by a period then the name of the property or method you want to access

## **Document Object Model**

*The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.*

**The following describes these data types:**

1- document When a member returns an object of type document (e.g., the ownerDocument property of an element returns the document to which it belongs), this object is the root document object itself.

2- Node Every object located within a document is a node of some kind. In an HTML document, an object can be an element node but also a text node or attribute node. 

3- Element The element type is based on node. It refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API. Rather than saying, for example, that the document.createElement() method returns an object reference to a node, we just say that this method returns the element that has just been created in the DOM. element objects implement the DOM Element interface and also the more basic Node interface, both of which are included together in this reference. In an HTML document, elements are further enhanced by the HTML DOM API's HTMLElement interface as well as other interfaces describing capabilities of specific kinds of elements (for instance, HTMLTableElement for elements).

4-nodelist A nodeList is an array of elements, like the kind that is returned by the method document.querySelectorAll(). Items in a nodeList are accessed by index in either of two ways: a- list.item(1) b- list[1] These two are equivalent. In the first, item() is the single method on the nodeList object. The latter uses the typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list. 

5-attribute When an attribute is returned by a member (e.g., by the createAttribute() method), it is an object reference that exposes a special (albeit small) interface for attributes. Attributes are nodes in the DOM just like elements are, though you may rarely use them as such. 

6-namedNodeMap A namedNodeMap is like an array, but the items are accessed by name or index, though this latter case is merely a convenience for enumeration, as they are in no particular order in the list. A namedNodeMap has an item() method for this purpose, and you can also add and remove items from a namedNodeMap.
