## **Forms**

A webform, web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields.
*An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.*

## **Events**

*JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.*

1. User Interface events
These occur as the result of any interaction with the browser window rather than the HTML page. In these events, we attach the event listener to the window object, not the document object.

2. Focus and blur events
These events fire when the HTML elements you can interact with gain/ lose focus. They are most commonly used in forms.

3. Mouse events
These events fire when the mouse moves or the user clicks a button. All the elements of the page support these events and use the bubbling approach. These actions work differently on touchscreen devices. Preventing the default behavior of mouse events can cause unexpected results. 

4. Keyboard events
These events fire on any kind of device when a user interacts with a keyboard.

5. Form events
These events are common while using forms on a webpage. In particular, we see the submit event mostly in form of validation (checking form values).

6. Mutation events and observers
Whenever the structure of the DOM tree changes, it triggers a mutation event. The change in the tree may be due to the addition or removal of a DOM node through your script. But these have an alternative that will replace them: mutation observers. 

7. HTML5 events
These are the page-level events included in the versions of the HTML5 specialization. New events support more recent devices like phones and tablets. They respond to events such as gestures and movements.

8. CSS events
These events trigger when the script encounters a CSS element. As CSS is a crucial part of web development, the developers decided to add these events to js to make working with CSS easier.
