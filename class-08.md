## **Layout**

*CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout, then test your grid skills before moving on.*

### Controlling the position of element

- Normala flow

position: static;

when I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default

- Relative position

position: relative;

Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow

- Absolute positing

position: absolute;

When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.)

Fixed positioning

position:fixed;

It positions the element in relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place

- Overlapping elements

z-index

If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property

- Floating elements

float 

The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

- Clearing floats

clear

The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. It can take the following values:

left : The left-hand side of the box should not touch any other elements appearing in the same containing element

right : The right-hand side of the box will not touch elements appearing in the same containing element.

both : Neither the left nor right-hand sides of the box will touch elements appearing in the same containing element

none : Elements can touch either side
