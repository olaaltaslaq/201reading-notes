## **1. Fade in**

*Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change, for example on hover*

## **2. Change color**

Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them.

## **3. Grow & Shrink**

To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.

## **4. Rotate elements**

CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element.

## **5. Square to circle**

A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.

)

## **6. 3D shadow**

3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen.

)


## **7. Swing**


Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.

)

## **8. Inset border**


One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.

# Transforms


***The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.***

# Transitions & Animations

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

*Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.*
